title: Writing a Solid App
---

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with Javascript, know how to write regular Web Apps, and are
interested in building one that stores data to a [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) Pod.

It does not assume prior knowledge of
Semantic Web technologies, Linked Data, RDF, or knowing what those terms mean in the first place.
